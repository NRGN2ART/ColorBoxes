<p> Pictures show a version packaged inside a "Record O Fone" answering machine device. The redbox design provides the same functionality as a cover until a secret password is "punched in" on the buttons. "Record O Phone" PCB design by C.M. / C.H.O. ? A supply of surplus "Record O Phone" devices were obtained for this purpose :) Note the Legendary "TRANS-AM" price tag.
